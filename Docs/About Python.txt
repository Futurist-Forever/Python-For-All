# Python Programming Language
Python is an open source, object-oriented, high-level programming language developed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science, Netherlands.
It is presently owned by Python Software Foundation (PSF).
Python is based on the ABC language, a teaching language created to replace the programming language BASIC, which was developed earlier.
Python is general-purpose programming language that can be used effectively to build any kind of program that does not require direct access to the computer hardware.
